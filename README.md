# StarWarsWebsite-frontend
In this project, I fetched information from swapi.dev and designed a website. When you click on films, people, planets, species, starships, or vehicles sections on the website, it takes you to the images and information related to that category. In pages, there are buttons to fetch the informations related to the categories. I used, Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS. You can open this project via Visual Studio Code. You can run the project by writing "ng serve --port 4300" in terminal. You can check my profile for backend part which is written in ASP.NET CORE 7.0 . First, you should run backend part to get datas.  Here are some images from website.
